#### What is Decidim

> Free Open-Source participatory democracy, citizen participation and open government for cities and organizations

[Decidim](https://decidim.org) is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation website. Installing these libraries will provide you a generator and gems to help you develop web applications like the ones found on [example applications](#example-applications) or like [our demo application](http://staging.decidim.codegram.com).

All members of the Decidim community agree with [Decidim Social Contract or Code of Democratic Guarantees](http://www.decidim.org/contract/).

# What do you need to do?

* [Getting started with Decidim](#getting-started-with-decidim)
* [Contribute to the project](#how-to-contribute)
* [Modules](#modules)
* [Create & browse development app](#browse-decidim)

---

## Getting started with Decidim

TLDR: install gem, generate a Ruby on Rails app, enjoy.

```console
gem install decidim
decidim decidim_application
```

We've set up a guide on how to install, set up and upgrade Decidim. See the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md).

## How to contribute

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Browse Decidim

After you create a development app (`bundle exec rake development_app`), you
have to switch to it and boot the rails server with `cd development_app &&
bundle exec rails s`.

After that, you can:

* Browse the main interface at `http://localhost:3000`, and log in as: user@example.org | decidim123456
* Browse the admin interface at `http://localhost:3000/admin`, and log in as: admin@example.org | decidim123456
* Browse the system interface at `http://localhost:3000/system`, and log in as: system@example.org | decidim123456

Also, if you want to verify yourself against the default authorization handler use a document number ended with "X".

### Community

If you need to have some features that we don't have yet, we recommend that you make a module. This is a Ruby on Rails engine with some APIs specific to Decidim (for registering with the menus, integration with spaces like Participatory Processes or Assemblies, with /admin or /api, etc).

As a base you can use these modules, although check first that the version is compatible with your current Decidim version. Also you should know that until v1.0.0 We're under development and these internal APIs can change. We recommend that you extensively test your module.
